## What is Natural Language Processing?

Natural language processing at its core is simply a method for a computer to understand human language. We've been doing this in chat bots for ages using if/then trees and switches. However, in recent years natural language processing has become more sophisticated. Some natural language processing uses statistical analysis on phrases, while other use neural networks to analyze and process words and sentences.

Natural language processing has come a long way and it's used everywhere from predective text to speech to text not to mention the newer more sophisticated chat bots that exist now.

But the ecosystems that exist to create a natural language process vary quite a lot. 

I've invited my friend Atticus Jack to help me with this post as he's a Java expert and was able to create a process in Apache Spark. Together we hope to show you the differences in implementation across Python, ML.NET, Apache Spark and Azure Cognitive Services.

We'll be providing commentary and opinions along the way as well, just to warn you.
