Recently I've been reflecting on all of the people that have helped me over the years. I'm thinking about co-workers, managers, friends, and family. I've been blessed with a wonderful array of people who have enriched my life beyond all expectation. 

So, now I am talking to you - you wonderful people who have been there for me. I want to thank all of you. I want other people to know you helped me and the kindness you have shown. Moreover, I you to know that I remember you. I remember laughing and joking with you. I remember struggling and striving together against adversity. I remember when you lifted me up. Yeah, sometimes there were hardtimes too, when we didn't agree - or my behavior wasn't good. I know that happened, but I don't remember it as well as the good times. 

And I'm going to thank you personally. As many people as I can. Even knowing that this is impossible. There are so many that I can't possibly do it. I'm going to try anyway.

Just to make things more manageable, I'm going to break it up a bit so not everything will be in one article. I don't know how long this will take, probably a long time. I don't know how much I need to write, probably a lot.

## Part One - Family

### Dad

Thank you Dad. You made me who I am in so many ways. I remember when I was young we would talk. You always tolerated my little silly rants about this and that. You sheltered me from the world until I was ready. You did your best to plan the seeds of love, kindness, and duty in me. These virtues that you put in me, they are growing now. Everyday they grow a little bit more. Thank you for showing me the kind of man I want to be. Even more, thank you for showing me the kind of father I want to be. Thank you for accepting me when I was broken and taking me in when I was hurt. My whole life I knew that you and mom would always love me no matter what, unconditionally.

Thank you for all of the many things you taught me. Thank you for teaching me about God. Thank you for teaching me to pray. Thank you for teaching me so many little things from tying my shoes, to fishing, to friendship. It's because of you I'm where I am now. It's because you helped me when I needed it the most. Even when I was stupid, even when I was selfish, you were there. Thank you so much. I love you.
