A few weeks ago [I took a look at ML.NET.](/blog/take-a-look-at-mlnet). The purpose was to find an easy entry point into machine learning as a .NET developer so I could start looking for quick wins in the application.

I posted the article to [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/csharp/comments/iv7z6m/a_quick_look_at_mlnet_which_seems_to_be_a_library/) and I was delighted by the discussion that resulted. Most .NET developers working on ASP.NET applications have a reason to poke their heads out and see what's going on in other ecosystems. Many prefer to wait for the .NET implementation to become available and supported before experimenting and theorizing on custom integrations for new and existing applications.

A few, however, will venture out of the ecosystem frequently. To some of them machine learning is a core skill and they already know a great deal about training a model, neural nets and similar. However, there is an asymmetrical sharing of information and as it regards ML.NET it's not clear what is correct and what is not. 

Lets take a look at the questions and criticisms leveled toward ML.NET. I'll do my best to research and answer each one.

## Does ML.NET support natural language processing?

### What is natural language processing (NLP)

Natural language processing is how computers can analyze and understand normal human text, or ordinary language. So a normal human can provide a computer with normal chat messages, for example, and the computer can provide appropriate responses according to how it's trained.

There are two approaches to NLP in machine learning. The first is what's called the statistical approach where a large body of data is used to train a model. The newest approach is to use deep neural networks which use a variety of techniques to get good results. 

Lets talk about one such approach called "word embeddings". Word embeddings refers to a process where words and phrases are mapped to vectors of real numbers. It's basically judging a word by the surrounding words. So it tries to capture the meaning of a word by examining the context, but all of the words have been reduced to numbers and the context is a vector of those numbers together from which a machine can derive some understanding, or at least determine an action. 

### How to do

## Can you train custom models in ML.NET?

## Can you write your own Neural Network in ML.NET?

## Is the Python implementation objectively better than ML.NET?

## What is the difference between Azure Cognitive Services and ML.NET?

## What are Microsoft's long term intentions with ML.NET?

### Can it be integrated with Unity?
