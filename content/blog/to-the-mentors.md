Over the course of my career I have had tremendous luck. I have known people who altered the course of my life with just a few words. Sometimes these people actively invested me, sometimes I adopted them whether they knew it or not. Always I saw something in them I wanted to emulate, whether it was a skill, talent, an easy way with people, professionalism, or even the ability to just chill.

These are my mentors.

I remember my first manager upon joining Nationwide Insurance as a contractor. I was a lumpy awkard twenty-something guy. I could speak and write well, but I dressed poorly and lacked professionalism. This manager had to pull me aside and have the "these clothes are not appropriate" conversation. (Turns out you can't show up to an office job wearing torn clothes.) I accepted the feedback with as much grace as I could and he chose to start helping me. He gave me the single greatest piece of advice a young person could receive. It was the advice that colored the rest of my career. I excelled when I followed it and failed when I didn't.

He said, "Be affable."

> Define Affable: friendly, good-natured, or easy to talk to.

## Be affable. Be someone that other people want as a teammate. Be friendly, helpful, considerate and kind.

It was simple advice, but exactly what I needed to hear as I had a tendency to be callous at times. So yes, swallow my proud words and behave kindly towards the people around me. Don't act out of frustration, irritation, or anger.

I was not an angry person to begin, but even so I recognized that I could do better. 

Sometime later I was hired as a full time Nationwide employee. My first year was rough. I had been customer facing, something I excelled at, but was moved to a data entry job. I did not do well there. I wanted to do well - I understood that I needed to learn what I could from this position in order to do well elsewhere, and yet I failed. There was another member of that team who did a great job everyday. I went to him and asked "Can you teach me?" And he did.

He had developed a personal routine that regularly produced superior quality and output. He showed me how to regulate my time better, how to keep better personal records, how to make better use of my tools. Most of all, he said - if you want to do your best work you have to give a damn. You have to care.

Care was the thing that I lacked in that job. I didn't care about it because I didn't like it. It was an epiphany that led me to requesting a different role. "Hey can I get back on the phones?" A month later I was leading my team in resolved issues and happy customers - and I was still picking up that valuable knowledge. 

## Care about what you're doing.

Later and I've been promoted and added to a new team. We had to call advisors about errors with paperwork, explain the error, and then work to resolve it. It was very difficult - maybe the hardest job I've ever had. Some advisors build credibility with their staff and their customers by appearing infallible. Poking holes in that image led to some extremely tough situations. 

We had to know our stuff very well. We had to be the experts over whatever narrow field the paperwork involved. Needless to say, I often fell short of that standard. I had a team lead who was extremely knowledgable. He had years of experience and our respect. He would answer my questions, but eventually as I became more knowledgable he started pointing me at resources. He'd frustrate me, but I started figuring things out for myself. As I became more knowledgeable other people began asking me questions. I realized my team lead had done something very clever. I was finding my own answers. I was learning _how_ to find my own answers.

## Find your own answers, also - let people find their own answers.

A few years later I'm finally learning to code. I've created programs for my teammates. I've got the support of my manager and I've never been so excited about what I'm doing. And then I get in trouble. I have meetings with HR. It feels scary, like I could get fired. (I wrote about the whole story of how I became a developer [here.](/blog/how-i-got-started)) My manager was not invited to this meeting. And yet, he showed up. He said "Hey, just want to let you know I think what James is doing is great! Anyway, just popping in between meetings." And then he left. Shortly after that another manager popped in and said "We love what James has been doing! Thanks - have a great day."

That moment pivoted me. Never in my life had I felt as supported by management as I did then. Never, in my contentious history with authority did I imagine that I would ever be the beneficiary of that. That manager had stuck by me through rough moments previously - but here he had orchestrated a show of support for me. I thanked him later but I don't think he ever knew how much that event changed me.

## Support your people through adversity.

Pleasant years followed that until I finally became a developer. My first technical lead taught me and encouraged me. He code reviewed my work with empathy. He focused on teaching me best practices and code smells. He suggested books to read and I read them. He also encouraged personal projects. The development work for the team was slow, buried in process, and tedious. Those personal projects kept me engaged and interested. I was able to power through the boring work by getting excited about my projects. Eventually I was even able to get one of my personal projects adopted by the business. It made a big difference.

## Find ways to keep yourself interested.

Eventually that technical lead left and one of the senior developers took his place. He had a different approach and focused on building bridges with other teams and working within the process to create better results. I felt I had been fighting "the process" for years. I believed that I had never gotten a good result by working _with_ the process. Yes, the process was flawed. It had slowed us down and forced meaningless administrative tasks. However, it also bound us together. Building those positive working relationships allowed us to break down where the process was broken and create meaningful changes.

## Solve process problems by building relationships.

## Shake things up to grow.

## Enthusiasm creates opportunities.
