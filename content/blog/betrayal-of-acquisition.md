## Wednesday

I loved my job. I worked for a small consultancy in a midwestern city. I'm a programmer and my work matters to this company. They rely on me to represent them well and when I do that it's entirely possible that the top leadership will be aware of it.

In fact, the leadership is pretty good. It's hard to be a leader at a small company. Not many people know that, but it's true. Employees second guess them and they have to be guarded about their promises because they will be held accountable. The office for our executives is ten yards from where I would sit (when we were in the office). Despite all of that pressure, they seemed to care about us. You could talk to them if you wanted to do so. They made what was important to them transparent. We had tough times and good times.

My immediate boss is also my mentor and friend. The executives know my face and recognize my name. When my father passed away earlier this year I received a kind note from one of them. 

I loved how my voice mattered. I could put something out there about our sales process, or our product offerings and our leaders would listen. My friends included several of the sales staff. I trusted them and they trusted me. We'd work together to try to understand how we could increase our company's revenue and also solve problems for our client. I was an important part of that. What I chose to do mattered. What I chose to say mattered. I believed in what we were trying to do.

I had been promoted this year. I was making great progress on my goals. The future looked bright. 

## Thursday

We receive notice for a mandatory hour long meeting a mere two hours before it's supposed to start. It's odd but I rearrange a few things so I can attend the whole time. I'd recently taken on a new mentee and I was supposed to meet with her as well. I looked forward to it as I believed she had great potential and I could help.

And then, the meeting begins.

We're being acquired by a huge multi-billion dollar company. 

They do the same thing as us, they're a consultancy with locations across world. They have shareholders and regional vice presidents. Our former executive tells us that their benefits are better. He strongly implies that the offer letters will be enticing. Also,

"We can get the contracts we were too small to pursue. We can win!"

And then I hear,

"We had to make the hard decision to let some of our non-billable office staff go..." He means some people in HR, some people in sales. Probably all of accounting. 

"We're going to take care of them though!" He means they get a severance package of some kind. Who knows how good it is though. They probably have to sign an NDA or something so they can't speak. They're in the meeting with us and the executive is tossing it out there: _Hey, you're axed and everyone knows it now._ Some of those people are my friends, or people I respect. I'm angry.

Next our new executive leadership team starts talking. The regional president talks for a while. He outlines how big and wealthy they are.  He shows flashy charts demonstrating how many people they employ. He's proud of the tens of thousands of people that work for him. We're joining his family. 

Imagine talking about having tens of thousands of employees and referring to them as family in the same breath.

What an asshole. 

Is he visiting them in the hospital? Is he loaning them money because their spouse got laid off? Hell no, he's viewing spreadsheets of aggregated earnings by location and sorted by performance and directing his subordinates to remove any underperforming assets.
Welcome to the "family". What a joke.

He tells us we're part of their great lakes strategy. I have a moment of confusion, _great lakes?_ We're nowhere near the great lakes. Oh wait, he's means we're in a state bordering a great lake. We're a small wheel in his big machine.

His other officers speak. "We're so excited!" "We all want to meet you!" I read online that they've acquired dozens of companies our size. They are not excited. They do not care. We are the third acquisition this month probably, who knows?

There is a Q&A time and questions pour in. What about PTO? What about 401K vesting? What about overtime policy?  The questions comfort me. Others have misgivings also. One of them makes a mistake here. They actually outline the overtime policy without knowing our existing one. Theirs is objectively worse. **Much worse**. One of the officer's eyes widen. She looks away typing. The hapless executive who gave too many details quickly trails off. They answer more questions, but now they use corporate-weasel-speak. They refer us to a FAQ. They provide an email `answers@company.com`

"We'll get back to you! These questions will all be answered!"

The meeting ends a half hour later than scheduled. The executives are fidgety and annoyed. They force smiles and sign off.

I am the biggest idiot in the world because I believed in my small company. I don't care about being the best in the state or _tHe GrEaT lAkeS._ I wanted to be do well in our little city. I wanted to create our own winning solution. I wanted to be a part of _that._

Those people will never know my name. I am faceless employee #20612. My job is to build application solutions for clients and thats it. No more creative process. No more brainstorming. They have people that do that. Our grand strategy is now resting comfortably in the trash bin. 

I call my immediate boss. He says he's cautiously optimistic. He encourages me to do the same. I try. I try very hard. I adopt language of positivity but it doesn't stick. I can't shake this feeling of anger and betrayal. I start checking on my friends "Are you safe?" Some are. Some aren't. It hurts. It sucks.

We get our offer letters. There is no change in salary. The 401K match is worse. The benefits appear to be worse. We have to get background checks. Our annual bonus is now contingent on accepting the offer letter. I have 3 business days to accept the letter. Why is this all happening so fast? I am now suspicious as well as angry.

I start digging into the emotion. I reason that if I can understand this feeling then I can defeat it. I can abandon emotional thinking and adopt a logical approach.

I realize that this company reminds me strongly of another consultancy I worked for in the past. They are direct competitors. I was abused at that consultancy. I realize that I deeply distrust the acquiring company as a result of that experience. I realize that I would never voluntarily elect to work for them. I would never apply for a job there. If I had other employment I would never accept an offer from them. 

Moreover, I realize I'm not just grieving for my laid off friends. I'm grieving because my values and goals no longer align with the company. I now _have to_ quit. I will not work for a company that does not share my values and is an impediment to my goals. 

I reschedule the mentee meeting. I try to get work done. 

Will my attitude change? _Can it change?_

I start bargaining with myself. _Just work until the bonus check is cashed and then get out._ _Just accept the offer and do the minimum until you can leave forever._ 

This all makes sense. 
That night I dream about rejecting the offer. It feels really good. I don't miss the bonus check.

## Friday - current day

I didn't sleep well. I woke at 1:30 AM and stared at the ceiling, thinking. 

What will I do today? The reasonable thing that guarantees my income or the empty glory of turning it down for the principles. Obviously I should do the reasonable thing. I should accept the offer. I enter into a contract with them, but I can leave anytime. 

If only I could somehow shake the suspicion that they are seeking to trick me. It's ridiculous. What would they gain? By my own estimation, I'm too unimportant to care about. So, why would they expend effort to decieve me? This is a manifestation of my distrust, but it's not logical. I perceive them as invaders so I want nothing to do with them. I am not one of them and I don't seek to be branded as one of them. I don't want to earn them a single dollar. 

But I must. I have a family and they need to eat. I'm the sole earner. I have to do this even though I hate it. 

And why do I distrust them so much. Is it all because of that other consultancy? It can't be. I think it's also because I didn't choose them. What I chose is gone now. I feel like they're forcing me. I feel tricked. It makes me feel sick. My stomach churns. I hate feeling powerless.
