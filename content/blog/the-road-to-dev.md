It's hard out there.

I think nothing has shown me that more than following and reading the heart breaking updates from recent bootcamp grads. They don't know it, but I've seen them. I've read their portfolios. I've read their posts on LinkedIn, which are alternating in bravery and despair. I feel for them.

I'm a lucky one. I taught myself to code while working an office job. I never used a bootcamp, but I thought about it. I was personally invited to join one by the founder of The Odin Project. He had just started his Viking School and was looking at promising students in his free online course. I was tempted! He seemed like he could help me acheive my dream of being a developer.

Ultimately, the finances didn't make sense to me so I passed. Wow, how different it would be had I not. At that time bootcamps were popping up everywhere but the demand for new developers was nowhere near sated. I would probably be happily writing on Ruby or JavaScript projects somewhere. Instead, I went down the path of .NET and got an enterprise job. It was pretty good.

The point is that it was harder to acquire the base skills, but easier to get a job. 

Now, it's different. Coding has become a symbol of upward mobility and people have flocked to the craft. This has naturally made the junior level jobs scarce.

So what to do? I've been thinking about that.

## The Easiest Way

Lets start with the easiest possible way to get a job. If you come from an office environment then the best thing is to network back into that company. Get in touch with people you know and try to find a way to reach the ears of a hiring manager in an IT department. Even if you're not in an office environment, say you come from a warehouse or a factory - ther are still office staff there and you should definitely network in that direction.

When you do this you become a triple threat. Not only do you have that base knowledge of coding (hopefully in the stack your company uses), but you also have knowledge about how the business operates and you're already accepted into the culture of the company. From a hiring manager's perspective this could be a slam dunk. It's way easier to bring in someone who kind of already knows their way around than someone who's completely fresh. You immediately put yourself on par with an experienced junior developer or even a mid-level.

If you were wise in your previous position and made friends and had a decent network then that makes you even more valuable. With a little thought you can be someone who knows where to get that requirement clarified, or steers the a coworker ( or even the team! ) around a critical detail that only someone experienced in business operations would know. This is particularly true if you work in a field with lots of fiddly regulator rules, like insurance or finance. You are made of gold if you've already got insight into existing systems and processes.

Of course that's not for everyone. Also, many people turn to code to flee their old job, not to return and conquer it. 

## The Traditional Way

It's harder, but the bootcamps are geared around this. This is the path of job fairs and competitive interviewing. If you are a super personable confident outgoing person who excelled in bootcamp then you'll tie this up. No problem!

However, if you have self-doubt and uncertainty and occasionally self-sabotage or if you didn't do so great in bootcamp (just well enough). Then you'll struggle here. But you can still pull it through by following the advice of your instructors and going all in studying and working on boosting your confidence. A few will make it in.

The companies that seek out bootcamp students are a mixed bag. Some are earnest and glad to get some people they can train the rest of the way. Others are seeking inexpensive coders to work long hours for as long as they before those coders get enough experience to get a job somwhere else. These companies need a name to exemplify their modus operandi, their sweat shop culture. Something like, "sweaty boot?" maybe. Wait how about "leather stretchers?" I don't know - there must be some moniker that fits.

Regardless this is still a good path. The rewards outweight the risks, but people can find themselves hovering here for a long time. Especially candidates who seek 100% remote work or are in a locale already saturated with top talent. It's harder for people who don't easily fit in with others or who feel different. Then they have to lean extra hard into people skills and having great talent.

So what do you do if the easy way isn't so easy and the traditional way has you circling the runway for an indefinite amount of time?

## Another Way

If a month or two goes by and you can't find a position then it's reasonable to start thinking of alternatives. 

I like people who are self-starters who will find a different game with rules that favor them. I value this skill a lot and I'm not the only one. 

Consider that keeping a portfolio of pretty but otherwise not useful projects can only get you so far. Why not try for real experience on your own terms?

I suggest looking around on Upwork or similar sites for a contract you think you can do for a price that suits you. Yes, I am suggesting going for real work. I know you're not experienced. But what if you tried anyway? What could you learn? 

Also, what the hell, if nothing else is working what will you lose if you fail?

Upwork might be too intimidating at first, but what about churches? What about professional groups or charities? If you're already doing portfolio work then why not do work that's meaningful and for a good cause. Yes it's free or low paid work, but what's your portfolio paying? Also, you might ask if you could include the work you do as part of your portfolio. If you do good work you might ask them for references too.

You know what, if you're doing all of that - you might as well form your own LLC and make yourself a fulltime employee of that company. (Congrats you're hired!)

Also, those people you just did good work for have a cousin who needs a website, can you help? What's your rate?

This is how it works. It makes it super easy to get hired by bigger company if you already have successful projects and you have experience talking to business people. 

There is a way to seize your own destiny if you want to do it. People who do this successfully are leaders in our industry. They are sought after. It's not easy though!

It's not for everyone but it's something to think about. From what I've seen, people who try this and fail are still miles ahead of people who go into interviews with only portfolios and prayers. 

## Patience, Practice, and People

Ultimately though, patience, skill, and your network will be your friends in this initial stage as well as throughout your career. 

* Yes, get into those interviews and put your best face forward. 
* Yes, practice at the craft and build up to showcase your skill.
* Yes, build up your network on LinkedIn and elsewhere.

That third point is the most important. And what do I really mean? I mean you should be trying to schedule chats with people who interest you. The goal from these chats is not to get an interview, but to learn. Ask about their business. Ask about what they like in their job. Ask about the culture. Listen to their responses and build follow up questions. You're not going to be good at this right away. You'll make mistakes and feel foolish from time to time. You'll make gaffes. Embrace that awkwardness! I try to do this three times a week even being fully employed. If you are not otherwise employed then you might try to do this three times a day. Don't exhaust yourself. If it feels like you're going through the motions then take the day off. Being genuine and authentic is very important. If you're tired it makes it a lot harder!

I think it's reasonable to ask, what's the point of all that? The point is to build relationships with people. You'll want to start conversations and contribute thoughts toward any problems they might have. People who get good at this are super valuable and can get jobs anywhere. 

And yes, eventually, someone will probably say "Wow, that's a great point. Hey are you looking for work?"
