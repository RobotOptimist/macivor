## A Bit of Background

I am a software developer living in the United States midwest. I'm also the dev lead for a small team. I've been at this company for a year come May and about four months in my current role as dev lead.

I started coding professionally in 2012. I've had the title of software developer since 2015. I've been working across a wide variety of organizations since then. I've worked as part of a team, as a lead, and as the sole developer on a project. I've worked as both a developer directly employed by a company and as a consultant.

I've been hired and quit companies a bunch of times. I've even been the sole proprieter for a business and hired interns. 

Lately, I've been doing a lot of interviewing for my company. My current company does three interviews - a half hour introductory interview, an hour long technical interview, and a culture fit interview. I've been part of the first and second interviews.

The point is that I've seen a lot of stuff. I've been in both great and crappy situations. I want to talk about the crappy situations.

## How It All Works

Before we get into those crappy situations, lets go over the recruiting process for software developers.

### Being Available

Depending on your level of experience this phase can be very different.

New developers, either out of college or from a bootcamp will find this is pretty tough. They basically have to advertise their availability and expertise. 

Experienced developers are on the other side of coin. Recruiters are constantly probing for availability in emails, texts, calls, over social media - whatever they think will work. If you're not available then the follow up question is "Well do you know anyone who is?" A developer who advertises availability can expect to be flooded with messages and interest.

### Mutual Interest

Having established availability now mutual interest needs to be established.

Its a huge struggle for new developers because most recruiters have no clue about tech. New devs with a front end focus may have a slightly easier time as they can craft user experiences made for non developers. People with a back end focus will struggle, they may have amazing github projects - but recruiters have no idea if they're looking at something brilliant or something trivial.

Experienced developers will be overwhelmed with communication trying to convince them that their interest should go with whichever recruiter happens to have them at that moment. It's awful. The fear of missing out on various opportunities is a daily question to be asked.

This is also when recruiters may be tempted to lie or embellish about their various clients.

### Interviewing

At last, its time to talk to people at the company. These are great. Typically the hiring manager will take time to educate you about the company. I personally enjoy this phase of the process as the candidate. Even the technical interviews are opportunities to learn a bit.

Look there are plenty of places to learn how to conquer the interview process. They're all wrong of course. Some companies care about leet code. Some of them care about soft skills. Some of them try to measure your ability to think through a problem, others how you deal with pressure.

### Negotiation

### Offer

### Onboarding
