                <p>I love working, but I'm not my job. I like a whole bunch of things - most of all I love hanging out with my family. </p>
                <p>I play games, like table top roleplaying games and video games.</p> 
                <p>I get political from time to time. I'm love science fiction and fantasy novels, shows and movies.</p> 
                <p>Coding is fun, and I'm glad to do it as a hobby as well as my job - but I do a bunch of different stuff. It's important not to be one sided, yeah? </p>
                <p>The common thread is I love whimsy and doing things for the joy of doing it.</p>
